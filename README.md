# aviation-crash-analysis
Data-driven analysis of global aviation crashes (1908–2009) in Tableau, highlighting operational and environmental factors to support safety insights for flight crews.

**Overview**
Tableau project analysing global aviation crashes (1908–2009) to identify key risk factors and trends. Focused on insights relevant to flight crews to support safety awareness.

**Problem**
Crash rates in developing regions remain high due to weak oversight and outdated infrastructure, causing 5,000+ crashes and 100,000+ fatalities.

My Focus (John-Paul Martin)

Analysed aircraft families most frequently involved in crashes.

Explored time-of-day patterns linked to higher crash rates.

Designed dashboards highlighting operational risk factors for crews.

**Data Prep**
Cleaned with Tableau Data Interpreter, split aircraft types into family/model, verified data types, filled gaps, and created metrics.
